# Mastering Go

This repository contains the code examples and exercises I've worked through while reading "Mastering Go" by Mihalis Tsoukalos.  This is a personal learning project to solidify my understanding of the Go programming language.

The book can be found on the [O'Reilly website](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/mastering-go/9781805127147/).
